# Multiple Surface Segmentation of the Retinal Layer in OCT Images

# Data
Preprocessed data for this experiment were provided by CharitÂ´e University Hospital Berlin. <br/>
Data consist of the images of 53 healthy eyes. Each eye contains 47-49 scans (images) which makes 2597 images in total.<br/>
We are not allowed to upload data and use outside of the class.<br/>

# Methods
We have compared 2 methods, which were proposed for medical image segmentation, namely UNet and CNN-S. <br/>
UNet code was forked from https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet

# Results:

UNet: <br/>
